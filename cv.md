## **👀 About Me**

I like information technology, programming and everything related to computer science. I became a student at RSschool to gain experience in IT, as well as the necessary skills and practice. I am not afraid to set challenging goals and achieve them.


## **😎 My Skills:** 

+ HTML5
+ CSS3(SASS)
+ JS(Basic)
+ FIGMA
+ Git


## **✍ Sample Code**
>  js:

```javascript
       function factorial(n){ 
            if(n < 0 || n > 12){
                throw new RangeError();
        }else {
            return n ? n * factorial(n - 1) : 1;
        }
    }   
```


## **✨ Work Experience**
Practical experience in web development and programming is small. 
I am engaged in the layout of small projects from figma. I solve tasks on the codewars.
